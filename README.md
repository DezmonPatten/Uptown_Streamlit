### Uptown Cheapskates Sales Performance Dashboard
This repository contains two Streamlit applications designed to visualize and analyze sales performance for Uptown Cheapskates, a retail store. These apps provide insights into key sales metrics to help store managers make informed decisions.

## Applications
1. September Sales Dashboard
This version of the app uses a predefined dataset from September. It provides an in-depth analysis of sales performance during that specific month. Key features include:

Sales Trends: Line graphs displaying sales trends over time.
Category Insights: Visualizations of top-selling product categories.
Employee Performance: Heatmaps and bar charts highlighting checkout performance by staff.
Customer Patterns: Insights into high-traffic times in the store.
2. Custom Dataset Dashboard
This version extends the functionality of the first app by allowing users to upload their own datasets. It offers the same visualizations as the September Sales Dashboard but provides the flexibility to analyze data from any time period or custom datasets specific to the store.

## Features
Both dashboards offer the following features:

Interactive charts and visualizations.
Easy-to-navigate interface.
